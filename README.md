Structure
---------

* *experiments* - Contains the scripts for the short-term memory assessment, and for the collaborative short-term memory game. The experiments are written in Python, and designed to run in the Lund Humanities Lab Digital Classroom.

* *data* - Contains the data collected from the short-term memory assessment, and from the collaborative short-term memory game. The data is organised in sessions.

* *analysis* - Contains Python scripts to analyse the data. The script `extract_data.py` should be run before the script `generate_plots_for_manuscript.py`. The script `reward_simulation.py` can be run independently, as it is a simulation. The file `nclaimed_personality_multi-variable_regression.jasp` can be opened using JASP.
